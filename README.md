        <p> Hi fellow ninjas! This is <strong>EthanNinja</strong> here and <em>I'm happy to say that I've started to learn HTML!</em></p>
		<p> If you are <em>not</em> a fellow ninja, lemme teach you how to be a ninja and some basic info!<p>
		<div style = "text-align: center">
		<h2>Basic Info About Ninjas</h2>
		</div>
		</ol>
		<li> <div style= "color : red";>Ninjas are stealthy spies who gather information from enemies to report to their masters.</div></li>
		<li> <div style= "color : blue";>They are <strong>NOT</strong> spies who are good at fighting. They're better at assasination and stealth attacks.</li>
		<li><div style= "color : orange";>They carry various tools used for missions.</div></li>
		<p>That's some basic info about ninjas and let's start discussing about their tools!</p>
		<div style = "text-align: center">
		<h2><div style= "color : gray";>Basic weapons</div></h2>
		</div>
		<ol>
		<li> Shuriken(Ninja Star)</li>
		<p>The shuriken is a type of blade held in a ninja's hand. The most common shuriken is the <strong>star-shaped shuriken</strong>. They're other types of them as well. <br>
		Ninjas can hurl this <em>deadly </em>blade and assasinate people. Some ninjas dip their shurikens in poison or set fire on it!<br>
		But ninjas don't carry a lot of shurikens; they usually just carry three or more.</p>
		<li>Katana(Ninja Sword)</li>
		<p>The Katana is a kind of sword held by ninjas in dangerous missions. It is <strong>shorter than the average sword</strong> held in battles, but except fighting, this weapon can by used for a lot of other ways.<br>
		You could use it to climb short walls, and place it on the ground and <em>step onto its handle</em>, then pull it up with a string while you were on the wall.</p>
		<li>Fuyika(Blowgun)</li>
		<p> The Fuyika is a blowgun. It shoots darts(sometimes <em>poisoned</em>) from a distance. <strong>And it made almost no sound!</strong> A ninja would breathe out and a small groan from the victim (as the victim falls) would be heard. But it had other uses, such as a snorkel. </p>
		<li>Kunai(Blade)</li>
		<p> The kunai is the most commonly used ninja weapon. It is a small lightweight metal dagger that had <em><strong>tons of uses</strong></em>: digging holes to invade enemy bases, to fend off <strong>blows or arrows</strong>, used as a grapple and etc. </p>
		<li>Nunchucks</li>
		<p>The nunchuck is a kind of weapon where <strong>two handles are connected with a metal chain</strong>. It could be used to fend off <em>almost any kind of weapon</em>'s blow or <em>disarm a guy</em>.<br>
		You wold also whip it around above your head and whap it at the enemy.</p>
		<h4>To be honest, they're more kinds of weapons but it's nearly impossible to list them all out! These are some of the basic ninja gear.</h4>
		</ol>

		<h2>Clothing</h2>
		</div>
		</div>
		<p>In your brain, you might picture ninjas wearing pitch-black clothes that blended in in night. But that's wrong! Ninjas wore clothes in a color between blue and black. That way, in the day they'd look like normal people, <strong>because in Japan, normal people wore blue clothes!</strong></p> <br>
		<p>Ninjas have <em>twelve pockets</em> in their ninja clothing. They'd put tools and wepons like shuriken in these pockets and grab them in the time of need!</p>
		<div style = "text-align: center">
		<div style = "color: green">
		<h3>Interesting Fact</h3>
		</div>
		</div>
		<p>Ninjas also have weapons hidden in normal, everyday things. For example, one day a ninja is ao a mission and he's disguised as a old man. He's carring a walking stick and suddently boom! Enemies jump out from nowhere. Then the ninja would oepn the stick and grab their blade from it!<br> </p>

		<div style = "color: gray">
		<h2>Other Weapons</h2>
		</div>
		</div>
		<ol>
		<li>Metal Fists</li>
		<p>Sometimes ninjas carried <strong>metal fists</strong> so when physical combat has taken place the ninja can put on their metal fists and sock the enemy in the face!<br>
		<em>This was a dangerous weapon, as it was very heavy.</em> Some other kinds of these weapons include fists with spikes on them and even rings that acted as claws! </p>
		<li>Bombs</li>
		<p>Can you believe it? Ninjas carried <em>bombs</em>! They'd set fire to it and throw it at the enemy, like a grenade. There are diffrent types of bombs. One of them is the <em>smoke bomb</em>, and it would explode in a puff of smoke and the ninja could use the confusion of the enemy and run away or steal!</p>
		</ol>

		<h2>Ninja meals</h2>
		</div>
		</div>
		<p>The meals ninjas eat in missions are not like normal lunches and dinners. They eat small food balls that have a lot of types, like types where you can quench your thirst or types that can kill your sleepiness.</p>
		<div style = "text-align: center">
		<div style = "color: pink">
		<h2>Ninja psychology</h2>
		</div>
		</div>
		<p>The best weappon of the ninja is the psychology of them. They train to face fears, pain, danger... normal people would be terrfied you would likely be killed in missions. But if you feared, the chances of dying are way more higher.<br>
		They thought diffrently from normal people. Normal people would think, "What would happen if I die?" But we ninjas thought, "anything might happen so I need to be calm." This is the secret weapon of ninjas.</p><br>
